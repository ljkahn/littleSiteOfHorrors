When the user arrives at The Little Site of Horrors they can click a ‚ÄúSee All Movies‚Äù button to see all the movies on the database. To create a profile click the ‚ÄúLogin‚Äù button and sign up. Once they are logged in they can create a profile.

On their profile they can pick an avatar, answer three questions about their favorite spooky season snacks, activities, and costumes. In addition to answering questions, once the user is logged in they can also add movies from the all movies page to their favorited movies. When the user goes to their profile they can list their top five favorite movies and have a carousel of their favorited movies.
