# littleSiteOfHorrors

## Description

The Little Site of Horrors was created for the die-hard gore fans and the easily startled fans alike! Our motivation for creating this website was to have a place where horror movie fans of all genre's can discover new movies, create a user profile to save their favorites, and answer fun spooky questions about themselves. The user can also leave reviews on the movies that theyve enjoyed (or not).
